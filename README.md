### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: Classification and Trend Analysis of the Philosophy according to Era
+ This project is conducted by Yalin Wang

+ Project summary: [a short summary] The initial goal of this project was to build a classification model with the data. After all, a book of philosophy represents an effort to systematically organize one's thought about the world. Using the data from the history of philosophy to classify texts would thus enable us to, by proxy, classify how people think about the world. Where some projects focus on sentiment analysis, here we focus on conceptual, or ideological analysis. Once we understand a person's worldview, there is no limit to what we can do with that information - from advertising to political campaigning through to self-exploration and therapy.
